# Materials Science Chart Atlas

Use this atlas when choosing a production figure family before coding. Each
chart type links a **materials claim** to a **safe code pattern**, a **visual
reference**, and the **reviewer risk** most commonly flagged for that chart
type.

**Start with the claim, then choose the chart.** Do not start with the
prettiest chart and retrofit a claim.

Each entry below includes: chart family name, best use, code pattern (Python),
reviewer risk, and when NOT to use the chart.

]
make_grouped_bar(ax, labels, groups, values, PALETTE_CBM, error_bars=errors,
                 ylabel="Bond strength (MPa)")
```

dosage = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
strength = [0.45, 0.58, 0.72, 0.78, 0.71, 0.63]
sd = [0.04, 0.05, 0.05, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04]
make_line_trend(ax, dosage, [strength], ["Bond strength"], PALETTE_CBM,
                xlabel="WER content (%)", ylabel="Bond strength (MPa)",
                fill_between=[sd])
# Mark optimum region
ax.axvspan(12, 18, alpha=0.12, color=PALETTE_CBM["optimal"])
ax.annotate("Optimum range", xy=(15, 0.78), xytext=(18, 0.82),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", color="#4F7C6A"),
            fontsize=8, color="#4F7C6A")
```

# Simulated spectra
neat = gaussian_peak(wn, 3400, 50) + gaussian_peak(wn, 1730, 30) + gaussian_peak(wn, 915, 20)
cured = gaussian_peak(wn, 3400, 45) + gaussian_peak(wn, 1730, 35)  # 915 peak gone
make_ftir_overlay(ax, wn, [neat, cured], ["Neat resin", "Cured (7 d)"],
                  PALETTE_CBM,
                  peak_annotations={915: "Epoxide", 1730: "C=O", 3400: "O–H"})
```

**When NOT to use**:
- Quantitative comparison (use bar chart of peak heights instead).

**Reviewer checklist**:
- [ ] Key peaks annotated with wavenumber.
- [ ] X-axis inverted (wavenumber decreases left to right).

                 PALETTE_CBM, ylabel="Bond strength (MPa)")

# Panel b: retention ratio
retention = [r / b * 100 for r, b in zip([0.28, 0.52, 0.66, 0.55],
                                           [0.45, 0.62, 0.78, 0.71])]
make_grouped_bar(ax2, labels, ["Retention"], [retention],
                 PALETTE_CBM, ylabel="Retention (%)")
```

---

## 11. Heatmap (Diverging / Z-Score)

**When to use**: Showing **deviation from mean** across conditions — each cell
shows how far that value is from the column mean in standard deviation units.

**Common materials claims**:
- "The 15% WER group shows above-average performance across all conditions
  except freeze-thaw."

**Code pattern**:

```python

---

## 13–20. Additional Chart Types

### 13. Mechanism Schematic

**Use for**: Evidence-chain summary, interface mechanism, reaction pathway.

**Rules**:
- Solid arrows = direct evidence. Dashed arrows = inferred steps.
- Color by evidence tier: green = measured, orange = inferred, grey = speculative.
- Label each step with the characterization technique that supports it.
- Do not draw causal loops without mechanistic evidence.

### 14. Evidence Heatmap (Review Figures)

**Use for**: Literature evidence coverage matrix.

**Layout**:
- Rows = claims or mechanisms.
- Columns = evidence layers (FTIR, SEM, XRD, mechanical, durability, field).
- Cell values: ✓ (direct), ~ (indirect), ✗ (absent), ? (not searched).

**Rule**: Empty ≠ absent. Distinguish "not searched" from "no evidence found."

### 15. Research Gap Matrix

**Use for**: Gap identification in review papers.

**Layout**:
- Rows = topics or sub-topics.
- Columns = study counts or evidence depth.
- Color = coverage level (red = few studies, green = many studies).

**Rule**: "Few studies" ≠ "no studies." State exact counts.

### 16. Graphical Abstract

**Use for**: Visual summary for journal submission.

**Rules**:
- Follow journal-specific size requirements.
- Show the workflow and key result, not every experiment.
- One clear take-away message.
- No overclaiming in the visual summary.

### 17. Pavement Layer Diagram

**Use for**: Interface / tack coat positioning, field test locations.

**Rules**:
- Cross-section schematic with labeled layers.
- Mark test locations with symbols.
- Include thickness and material specification.
- Note: this is a schematic, not a to-scale drawing.

### 18. Scatter / Bubble Plot

**Use for**: Two-variable correlation, optionally with a third variable as size.

**Code pattern**:

```python
ax.scatter(x, y, s=size_var * scale, c=colors, edgecolors='white',
           linewidth=0.8, alpha=0.9)
ax.axvline(np.median(x), lw=1.2, ls='--', color='#767676', alpha=0.6)
ax.axhline(np.median(y), lw=1.2, ls='--', color='#767676', alpha=0.6)
# Label quadrants
ax.text(0.95, 0.95, "High-High", transform=ax.transAxes,
        fontsize=7.5, color='#888888', style='italic', ha='right', va='top')
```

**Reviewer checklist**:
- [ ] Trend line or correlation coefficient if claiming correlation.
- [ ] Not extrapolating from clustered data.
- [ ] Outliers identified and discussed.

### 19. Forest / Interval Plot

**Use for**: Effect sizes with confidence intervals, meta-analysis style.

**Code pattern**:

```python
ax.errorbar(effect_sizes, y_pos, xerr=[ci_low, ci_high],
            fmt='o', capsize=4, color=colors)
ax.axvline(0, color='grey', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.8)
```

**Reviewer checklist**:
- [ ] Confidence interval level stated (95% CI).
- [ ] Effect size metric defined (mean difference, % change, Cohen's d).
- [ ] Sample size per group shown.

### 20. Contour / Response Surface

**Use for**: DOE response optimization (two factors, one response).

**Code pattern**:

```python
ax.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=20, cmap='YlOrRd')
ax.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=5, colors='k', linewidths=0.5)
ax.set_xlabel('Factor A')
ax.set_ylabel('Factor B')
cbar = fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax)
cbar.set_label('Response')
```

**Reviewer checklist**:
- [ ] Experimental points overlaid on the surface.
- [ ] Model type stated (linear, quadratic, RSM).
- [ ] R² or adjusted R² reported.

## Visual Asset Locations

- `assets/rich-gallery/generated/` — general materials figures (SVG)
- `assets/wer-ea-atlas/generated/` — WER-EA specific figures (SVG + PNG)
- `assets/review-first/generated/` — review-oriented figures (SVG)
- `assets/showcase-proof/` — proof board PNGs

## Usage Rules

- Keep performance figures separate from mechanism figures unless both
  measurements exist.
- Do not use a mechanism schematic as proof of chemical reaction.
- Do not infer durability from short-term bonding strength.
- For waterborne epoxy modified emulsified asphalt, separate emulsion
  stability, epoxy curing, interface bonding, viscosity, storage stability,
  and moisture/aging evidence.
- Put control, dosage, temperature, curing condition, and test standard in the
  figure plan or caption when available.

## Python-only expanded chart gallery

The Python-only gallery extends the matplotlib coverage with ten publication
chart families that map cleanly to common materials datasets: scatter
regression, boxplot with points, violin distribution, contour response map, 3D
response surface, polar performance, errorbar trend, dual-axis trend,
correlation heatmap, and stacked composition. Example scripts live in
`scripts/figures4materials/plot_*.py`, with synthetic CSV inputs under
`scripts/figures4materials/data/`.

Use these helpers when the source data are tabular and the claim can be kept
close to measured columns. The safest pattern is: source CSV -> helper function
-> SVG/PNG exports -> caption boundary. For optimization figures, show the
measured points or grid so reviewers can see where interpolation begins.
Use scatter regression only for association claims unless independent mechanism
evidence is present.

```python
from materials_plot_lib import (
    make_scatter_regression, make_contour_map, make_3d_surface,
    make_correlation_heatmap, make_stacked_composition_bar,
)
```

Reviewer rules:

- Scatter regression and correlation heatmap show association, not mechanism.
- Contour response map and 3D response surface must not imply validity outside
  the measured factor range.
- Polar and stacked composition charts need raw values or mass-balance notes in
  the caption or supplement.
