# Reviewer Risk Writing

Check every draft for these risks:

- overclaim from performance to mechanism,
- missing evidence for novelty,
- missing test conditions,
- missing replicate count or statistics,
- journal fit mismatch,
- durability wording without wet/aged/service conditioning,
- field application language without field or simulated-service data.

Reviewer-safe writing states what is proven, why it matters, and what remains bounded.

## Materials-specific reviewer risk dimensions

Beyond the general risks above, materials manuscripts attract focused reviewer attacks on six dimensions. Scan each dimension before submission.

### 1. Mechanism over-attribution

Inferring a full reaction or failure mechanism from a single characterization signal (for example, one FTIR peak disappearance, one SEM image, or one XRD shift).

- Self-check: does every mechanism claim have at least two independent characterizations cross-validating it?
- Fix: downgrade the claim to `consistent with` until a second technique is added, or add the second technique.

### 2. Incomplete dose-response

Reporting only the optimal ratio or dosage without the full curve, including the descending branch where performance drops.

- Self-check: is the complete tested range reported, including non-optimal groups?
- Fix: complete the curve, or explicitly state `only the range X-Y was tested`.

### 3. Lab-to-field leap

Claiming field or engineering applicability directly from lab-scale results obtained under controlled conditions.

- Self-check: is every performance claim bounded to the tested conditions?
- Fix: add `under the tested conditions` or an explicit scale/simulation boundary.

### 4. Hidden trade-off

Reporting a strength gain while omitting a toughness loss, or reporting a benefit while omitting the cost (workability, cost, durability, setting time).

- Self-check: are all materially affected key performances reported, including unfavorable ones?
- Fix: report the trade-off metric, or state that it was not measured.

### 5. Standard deviation

Citing a standard (ASTM, ISO, GB, JTG) while the actual test conditions deviate from it in specimen size, curing regime, loading rate, or temperature.

- Self-check: does every standard citation carry the full test conditions actually used?
- Fix: report the deviation explicitly, or rephrase as `based on [standard] with modifications`.

### 6. Insufficient statistics

Weibull analysis with fewer than 10 specimens; no error bars; no replicate count; claiming significant difference from n=3.

- Self-check: does every quantitative result carry a replicate count and an uncertainty estimate?
- Fix: add statistics, or downgrade the claim to `observed trend`.

## Adversarial self-review workflow

After drafting, switch to reviewer mode and scan every claim against the six dimensions above. Mark each located risk as `high`, `medium`, or `low`:

- `high`: a reviewer would likely reject or require major revision on this point.
- `medium`: a reviewer would request clarification or an additional sentence.
- `low`: wording polish only.

Fix every `high` risk before producing the output draft. Re-scan after each fix to confirm no new risk was introduced. Only output the draft when no `high` risk remains.
